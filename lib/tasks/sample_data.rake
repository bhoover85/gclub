                        Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), Red Dead Redemption features an open-world environment for players to explore, including 
                        frontier towns, rolling prairies teeming with wildlife, and perilous mountain passes - each packed with an endless flow of 
                        varied distractions. Along the way, players experience the heat of gunfights and battles, meet a host of unique characters, 
                        struggle against the harshness of one of the world’s last remaining wildernesses, and ultimately pick their own precarious 
                        path through an epic story about the death of the Wild West and the gunslingers that inhabited it. [Rockstar Games]")
