  I grew up playing video games. Like many others, I've spent countless late nights with my friends fighting on virtual battlefields, raiding dungeons and saving the galaxy from an alien threat.

  I often hear people reminisce about their gaming experiences. Some games come out that leave such a lasting impression that it defines an era. I thought it would be a cool idea to compile a list of great games that deserve to be remembered, played and enjoyed.

  This is not meant to be a list of highest rated games from Metacritic, although many will likely be highly rated. And it will no doubt leave some in disagreement. But hopefully it will expose some games that may have flown under the radar, and give them a brief chance to shine.
